# 2017-ClutchPractice

Java Code for our 2017 Practice Bot, ClutchPractice.

For the 2017 FRC Competition season, we used LabVIEW for our code, which can be found here (Link to be added). During the offseason bewteen 2017-2018, our team decided to switch to Java. This repository contains a modified version of the Clutch code, which we're using as a testbed for trying our various driver control code for 2018.
